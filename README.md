## 📌 Overview

This project provides an intelligent, web-based solution for detecting **poultry diseases** using **deep learning** and **image classification**. By uploading an image of a chicken, users can instantly receive feedback on whether the bird is healthy or affected by common diseases like:

- **Fowl Pox**
- **Newcastle Disease**
- **Coccidiosis**

If a disease is detected, the system also offers **informative insights** about the condition.
